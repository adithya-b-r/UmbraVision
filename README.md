### How It Works  
1. The **ultrasonic sensor** continuously measures the distance to nearby obstacles.  
2. If an object is detected within **90 cm**, the **buzzer** is triggered to alert the user.  
3. The **switch** controls the systemâ€™s power, allowing for easy operation.  
4. The **Arduino Nano** processes the sensor data and activates the buzzer accordingly.
